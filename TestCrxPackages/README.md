# Readme for the /TestCrxPackages/ directory

These `.crx` files are for internal use by testers, to test the updating of extensions.  There's an internal testing work item with instructions that testers use.

Files in this directory:
* `ciialmfkbbnfalikdcjgknhhodmpampi.crx`
* `kgcfnkdjfpnkfhjaphlllemjbmmpdcdg.crx`

These packages correspond to extensions that have been published to store sites.  These are simple game extensions that open the game in a popup page when the browser action is clicked.  These extensions are not demo extensions; they are actual extensions that are used internally for end-to-end tests.
