This directory contains packages that correspond to extensions that have been published to the following sites:
* [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com) - todo: specific product url(s).
* [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/) - todo: specific url(s).

These packages correspond to version 1.0 for the respective extensions. Later, the Microsoft Edge Add-ons team updated the versions on the stores to version 1.1.

These are used to check extension updates work fine through crowd-sourced manual testing.

The instructions for the manual testers have the test users download and install these packages with version 1.0, and then press the "Update" button to check for updates.  If updates work correctly (as expected), the installed extensions get updated to version 1.1.

These are simple game extensions, designed so that the store doesn't reject them as spam extensions.

They open the game in a popup page when the browser action is clicked.

These extensions are not "demo" extensions; they are actual extensions that are used internally for end-to-end tests.
